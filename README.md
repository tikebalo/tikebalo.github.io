# GML Launcher Registration Site

This repository contains a simple registration page and backend server that mimic the custom authentication described in the GML Launcher documentation.

## Running locally

1. Start the server:
   ```
   node server.js
   ```
2. Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.

The registration data is stored in `users.json` in the project root.
