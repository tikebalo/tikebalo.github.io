# Test Results

- Attempted to install backend test dependencies via `pip install -r backend/requirements.txt` to enable running the test suite.
- Installation failed because the environment blocks outbound package downloads via proxy (HTTP 403 Forbidden).
- No automated tests could be executed as a result.

See the terminal output chunk `9ae4f4` in the session log for details.
